  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt Optimizer</strong> is a Chrome Extension that helps users improve the quality of prompts sent to AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini by rewriting them for better clarity and effectiveness.</p>

  <p>This extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.</p>

  <p>When a user clicks the "Optimize" button, their prompt text is sent temporarily to an external optimization server solely for the purpose of generating a clearer and more effective version of the prompt. No personally identifiable information is included in this process, and the prompt is not stored, logged, or used for any other purpose.</p>

  <p>The extension does not track user activity, web history, or interact with other websites outside the supported AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).</p>

  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing or the project's GitHub repository.</p>

  <p>By using this extension, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
